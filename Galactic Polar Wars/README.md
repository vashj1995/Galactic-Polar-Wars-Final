Repository for all things related to the "Galactic Polar Wars" game being created by Rising Star Productions.


Galactic Space Wars is a 2D platformer with shooter elements. Coded in C++ using SDL.

"Space polar bears from the planet Uranus have traveled to Earth to source more food to try to remedy their dwindling food supply. Thinking that the only source of food they can take from Earth is penguins, they take a collection of them, freezing them for later use. You, a penguin whose containment pod fell off the shelf, wake up in the spaceship (now on the way back to Uranus) and must escape. Traverse the spaceship, save fellow penguins, defeat polar bear threats, and collect useful items. Make your way to the cockpit of the ship to take out the Captain, Gregory, and fly the ship back to Earth, saving the penguin race."
